Safety and data security is a priority for the Horizon community. If you have found a security vulnerability in our codebase, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

## Reporting security issues

We are committed to working with any security-concerned parties and keeping them updated throughout the process.

Horizon is under active development. Please consider this during the process.
